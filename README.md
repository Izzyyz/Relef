# Relef

## Description

#### Relef is a Colombian company created with the specific purpose of increasing the marketing of Asian products with a focus on the Chinese brand Laikou. Given that the majority of products of this brand are highly scarce in Latin American countries, for this reason Relef will be in charge of import and distribute this entire line of products, facilitating access to these products for many people, to experience and promote the care and health of our skin.
